To Install ENiX:
----------------
Please install automake and readline (dev) - these are ENiX 
dependencies.

Run the following commands:

1) ./configure
2) make

If this doesn't work, you are having difficulty and you have 
autotools, please try the following:

1) touch configure.ac configure Makefile.am Makefile.in
2) rm -f aclocal.m4
3) autoreconf
4) ./configure
5) automake
6) make

To Run ENiX:
------------
Run: ./WitchCraft, this starts up the WitchCraft shell.
Tap enter once, and this will initialise the memory files.
 
To see a list of commands available within WitchCraft, run

!HELP

To Load Personality Profiles:
-----------------------------
Perform ALL of the following commands in WitchCraft:

!LOAD TRAINING/ENGLISHGRAMMAR.TRAINING
!LOAD TRAINING/EMOTIONS.TRAINING 
!LOAD TRAINING/ADVANCED.TRAINING 
!LOAD TRAINING/ROBOTICS.TRAINING

ENiX default personality profiles will now be loaded with a
minimal functioning training set. 

To test that ENiX functions correctly activate the Unit Test
framework from within WitchCraft by running the command:

!TEST Examples/

To Use ENiX:
------------
Usage examples for ENiX can be found in the Examples directory. 
These examples can be run directly from WitchCraft using the 
command:

!LOAD Examples/<filename>

For help inside ENiX type: ":help", ":help :<command>" or 
":example :<command>".

I highly recommend reading the documentation for this as it's a
complex project and things WILL malfunction if the system if you
make mistakes. Please find the latest documentation at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/enixdev/files/ENiX3/Documentation/

In An Emergency:
----------------
To undo a command type: 

:UNDO

This only works once. If the problem is serious you can erase all 
memory using the command: 

:PURGE
